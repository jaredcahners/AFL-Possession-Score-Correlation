# AFL-Possession-Score-Correlation
Is there a correlation between the number of possessions a team has and their score in AFL? Pandas will tell us...

## Description
Here I use a data set of play-by-play data through round 19 of the 2021 Australian Football League season (630k+ lines, thanks Richard Little, https://github.com/alittlefitness/afl_play_by_play), to see how much of a correlation there is between the ratio of possessions between teams and the score ratio in a game. A walkthrough of this notebook can be found at https://discsanddata.com/2021/08/04/do-more-possessions-mean-more-points-in-afl/.
